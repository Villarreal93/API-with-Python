# API with Python
Using Youtube's API in Python to retrieve statistics about the official NFL Youtube channel videos'. The idea is to practice collecting data from a real database instead of importing a csv file with data. Once the data is retrieved, it can be saved as a pandas dataframe. The actual API key is censored and only the outputs of the code are shown.
