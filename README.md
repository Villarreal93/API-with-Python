# API with Python
Using Youtube's API in Python to retrieve statistics about the official NFL Youtube channel videos'. The idea is to practice collecting data from a real database instead of importing a csv file with data. Once the data is retrieved, it can be saved as a pandas dataframe. The actual API key is censored and only the outputs of the code are shown.

# Reference
I saw this idea on Nate's Youtube channel, and I'm only using it to learn. If interested, go watch his full video (& channel!) on how to do this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fklHBWow8vE
